# Font

Font of choice is [MonoLisa](https://monolisa.dev). It's fantastic but it's also a paid font so it shouldn't be included in the this repo.

## Installation

Head to [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/orders) to customize and download the font. Install per operating system.

## Variants

The following are the variants I use which differ from the default:

- Alt curly bracket (ss07)
- Alt parenthesis (ss08)
- Hexadecimal (ss11)
- Alt dollar (ss13)
- R without serif (ss16)
